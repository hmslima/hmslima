<h2>Hello World</h2>

<p>
    Hi, how are you?
</p>

<p>
    I will use this blog only when I need to publish bit longer texts, to make important announcements, or 
    to talk about timeless topics.
    For quick notes and small updates of projects of mine, I will prefer to use the social networks; you can see the links in the 
    home page.
</p>

<p>
    Initially I thought of making a blog with WordPress, but later I decided to use only JavaScript, thus I have more flexibility, 
    security, and I end up having a blog interily integrated to my website. 
    Know that the posts's dates only inform when they were published, but I will always be updating my publications, 
    which includes this one.
<p>
    Apparently I should say something else here, but I am the direct type, I don't like to “pad out”. So that's it, I hope that 
    you like the projects I make. Goodbye and see you then.
