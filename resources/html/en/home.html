    I've created this website to promote my projects, which are for the most part books, tales, drawings, and application 
    programs. The genres of literature and drawing in which I work the most are fantasy and scientific fiction, 
    but you may see some materials from other genres. In regard to the apps, they are usually utilities that run directly on 
    the browser, and the function of most of them is to give support to other projects.
</p>

<p>
    Everything that I publish here comes from my hobbies, I don't work in the artistic world, and I am not a professional 
    programmer, therefore, I dedicate myself to my personal projects only in my free time, that's why 
    I don't publish new things as quickly as I would like, but keep an eye on my social networks to see whether I posted 
    something new.
</p>

<p>
    If you're new here or wanna see again my materials, click on the 
    <b>Projects</b> and <b>Blog</b> buttons from the menu.

    To know the news, follow me on my social networks, especially Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
